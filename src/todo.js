  //seperate componnet for user avatar
  //change usefects for usememo where required
  //in settings menu pause game and end game buttons should exit settings menu and show their own menus
  //full ui redesign cohesive style and colors
  //opp attacks from beginning
//TODO KNOWN BUGS
//game continues after end screen
  //if game is left at end screen it continues by itself (maybe timeouts are being cleared and must be putin local memory)
  // If  game is left at pause screen for extended time the timers no longer work (mayb ebecause browser is clearing timeouts fro performance)
      //when resuming after extended time it just goes to end game screen
  //same happens if paused for too long >>>> SOLUTION: place timer variables lin local memory


 //TODO: IDEA CONVERT TO RANDOM for opp?
        //three random indexes, one for each word in randoShake array
        //set opp phrase to a template literals starting with "thou" then the three variables
        //extreme mode with full sentences
        //local memopry remmebers name hioghscore pic and difficluty
        //also look at animation "steps" they look like too many steps till end

  //TODO WHAT TO DO NOW?
  // continue User attack animation synchro and scoring function

  //Move non display logic code from user input to context 
  //new component for end game confirm screen or other solution (conditional rendering)
  //finish off any toDos and finish refactoring for now
